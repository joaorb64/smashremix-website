    "patch_notes": "SMASH REMIX - Falco Patch - EXPANSION PAK REQUIRED\r\nFalco joins the fight in Smash Remix. Falco is a bit slower than Fox with higher jumps and a shorter up special. His reflector that notably hits opponents upwards, and he makes up for his lack of a powerful up smash or up aerial with a stronger back aerial and single hit spike down aerial. Perhaps the most notbale change of all is to Falco's neutral special, Phantasm. Falco will use this new special in lieu of his blaster, giving him new options for recoveries and a rewarding vertical hit on the ground. Along with Falco comes two new stages, Corneria City and Deku Tree, as well as a multitude of balance changes for Ganondorf and Young Link. See the patch notes below for more details.\r\n\r\nPatch Notes\r\n\r\nCorneria City\r\n```\r\nThis new stage from sope takes place aboard the Pleiades in the skies above Corneria City. Currently replaces Peach's Castle.\r\n```\r\n\r\nGanon's Tower\r\n```\r\nBlast lines adjusted.\r\n```\r\n\r\nFalco (Changes from Fox)\r\n```\r\nPhantasm (Neutral Special) - This entirely new neutral special replaces Blaster and is heavily inspired by Falco's SSBM incarnation.\r\nFire Bird (Up Special) - Reworked. Faster startup and increased base knockback, with reduced velocity and distance.\r\nReflector (Down Special) - Reworked. Launches at a vertical angle. Knockback growth implemented.\r\nGrab - Slightly larger hitbox positioned closer to Falco's body.\r\nJab 1/2 - New SFX.\r\nDash Attack - Now launches at a more vertical angle.\r\nForward Tilt - Slightly increased base knockback (excluding lowest angle).\r\nUp Tilt - New animation. Now resembles the up tilt used by Falco's SSBB incarnation.\r\nDown Tilt - Reworked. Increased damage and knockback growth with a much smaller hitbox matching Falco's tail. New SFX.\r\nForward Smash - New animation. Now resembles the fsmash used by Falco's SSBM incarnation. Kills slightly earlier than Fox's forward smash.\r\nUp Smash - Reworked. Decreased damage and knockback. Reduced ending lag.\r\nBack Aerial - Reworked. Slower startup with increased damage and knockback. Reduced ending lag.\r\nUp Aerial - Reworked. Smaller hitboxes on both hits. First hit has with increased damage and decreased knockback. Second hit launches at a more horizontal angle with decreased damage. New SFX.\r\nDown Aerial - Reworked. Single hit spike with a strong and late hit.\r\nTaunt - New animation. Now resembles the taunt used by Falco's SSBM incarnation.\r\nAttributes - Falco is generally a bit slower and heavier than Fox, with increased jump heights.\r\n```\r\n\r\nYoung Link\r\n```\r\nUp Special - Reworked. Hitboxes have been readjusted heavily. Looping hits are much farther apart and will \"drag\" opponents throughout the motion of the attack. Grounded up special now launches vertically on the final hit.\r\nForward Aerial - Reworked. Weaker attack with faster startup and reduced ending lag.\r\nBack Aerial - Reworked. First hit is more diagonal and should connect more reliably. Second hit is weaker. Reduced ending lag.\r\nDown Aerial - Spike hitbox is slightly smaller to allow for easier intentional non-spike hits.\r\n```\r\n\r\nGanondorf\r\n```\r\nNew Model - Ganondorf has a new 3D model and trident.\r\nUp Special - New VFX. Slightly slower startup, armour on grounded up special startup.\r\nDown Special - Slower startup, faster movement on ground down special. Reduced endlag when grounded down special ends in the air.\r\nUp Tilt - New VFX. Slower startup, hitbox is larger, lasts twice as long, and has increased shield damage.\r\nForward Smash - Reworked. New VFX/SFX. Trident tip hitbox has retained its strength. Lower hitboxes have been nerfed.\r\nUp Smash - Reworked/rebalanced. Trident tip hitbox has retained a lot of its strength. Lower hitboxes have been nerfed.\r\nDown Aerial - Reworked. Slower startup and decreased duration with a much more powerful hit. Launches straight downwards.\r\nTaunt - Updated animation. Ganondorf now spins at the beginning of his taunt.\r\n```"
